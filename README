README for the bunsen-archive-keyring package
=============================================

The BunsenLabs project signs its Release files that are stored on the
package server with the keys contained in this package.

Each actively used key is placed in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ to be used 
by "apt" and its apt-key command in versions 0.6 and later.
The signatures of acquired Release files are checked against this key database.
